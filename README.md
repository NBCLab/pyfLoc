# pyfLoc
A PsychoPy implementation of the Stanford VPN lab's functional localizer task.

This implementation is not associated with the VPN lab, so any bugs are our own.
The Python code for this task is released under our selected license,
but the stimuli for the task must be taken from the VPN lab's [fLoc repository](https://github.com/VPNL/fLoc),
and any use of the stimuli should include an acknowledgement in any resulting research products
(see [here](https://github.com/VPNL/fLoc#citation)).

Please download the stimuli from that repository and place them in a folder named "stimuli" in the same folder as `fLoc.py` and `config.json`.

## Implementation information

This functional localizer task uses a mini-block design with different categories of images.
To keep participants focused on the task,
there is also a behavioral task that participants will perform throughout the localizer.
There are three options for this task: oddball, one-back, and two-back.

### Differences from the original task

While we have attempted to maximize similarity between this task and the VPN lab's task,
there are differences.
I'm not sure what those differences are, unfortunately.
