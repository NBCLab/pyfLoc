# pyfLoc
A PsychoPy implementation of the Stanford VPN lab's functional localizer task.

This implementation is not associated with the VPN lab, so any bugs are our own.
The Python code for this task is released under our selected license, but the stimuli for the task must be taken from the VPN lab's [fLoc repository](https://github.com/VPNL/fLoc), and any use of the stimuli should include an acknowledgement in any resulting research products (see [here](https://github.com/VPNL/fLoc#citation)).
